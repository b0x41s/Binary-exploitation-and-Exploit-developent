# Notes Exploit Development

## Check Library 
```bash
ldd [binary_name]
```

## Within GDB
```bash
vmmap
```

## All Functions Provided by Your System’s libc
```bash
nm -D /lib/$(uname -m)-linux-gnu/libc-*.so | grep -vw U | grep -v "_" | cut -d " " -f3
```

## Disable ASLR
```bash
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

If "BBBB" was an address of a function that is called, then "CCCC" (0x43434343) should be the return address to be restored after executing that function, and "DDDD" and "EEEE" should be arguments to that function. Of course, there could be more arguments; those two were used as an example.

```python
buffer  = 'A' * 516
buffer += 'B' * 4
buffer += 'C' * 4
buffer += 'D' * 4
```

- **BBBB** – EIP – the address of the function that will spawn the shell.
- **CCCC** – return address – the address where the execution flow returns to after the shell is closed. This can be literally any value, if we are not interested in exiting gracefully. However, we do mind, and this will be replaced with the address of the `exit()` function.

Since `system()` requires the least arguments, it will be simpler to use this function.

```c
int system(const char *cmd);
```

Find the system function:
```bash
readelf -s /lib/i386-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep "system"
```
